This document defines the logic gates for the AI to track Dispo reps selling to investors.

---

## 🏗️ Gate 1: The Hook (The Numbers)
**Objective:** Capture interest with the profit potential and ROI.
* **Script Segment:** "Hey (Buyer), I’ve got a heavy-hitter in (Neighborhood). Buy-in is ($$$), ARV is ($$$). It’s a bread-and-butter flip with a $50k spread. You interested in the numbers?"
* **AI Success Criteria:**
    * **Keywords:** "ARV", "Buy-in", "Spread", "ROI", "Bread-and-butter".
    * **Intent:** Leading with the financial benefit rather than property features.
    * **Tonality:** Professional, urgent, and authoritative.

## 📈 Gate 2: The Narrative (The Comp Analysis)
**Objective:** Build confidence in the valuation using market data.
* **Script Segment:** "The comps at (Address) just sold for ($$$). This is the worst house on the best street. Needs about $25k in cosmetics and you're at full value."
* **AI Success Criteria:**
    * **Keywords:** "Comps", "Sold", "Cosmetics", "ARV justification".
    * **Logic:** Comparing the subject property directly to recent neighborhood sales.

## 🔥 Gate 3: The Scarcity Anchor (The Competition)
**Objective:** Force a decision by establishing that the deal is moving fast.
* **Script Segment:** "I'm sending this to my top 5 buyers right now. I’ve already got walkthroughs being requested for tomorrow. If you want to lock this up, you have to move now."
* **AI Success Criteria:**
    * **Keywords:** "Top 5 buyers", "Walkthroughs", "Lock it up", "Moving fast".
    * **Tactics:** Creating a "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO) environment.

## 📑 Gate 4: The Terms (Transaction Clarity)
**Objective:** Filter for real buyers by setting non-negotiable closing terms.
* **Script Segment:** "Standard terms: $5k non-refundable EMD, 7-day close. We use (Title Company). Does your capital work with that timeline?"
* **AI Success Criteria:**
    * **Keywords:** "Non-refundable EMD", "7-day close", "Title company".
    * **Verification:** Confirming the buyer has the funds ready and agrees to the speed of the deal.

## 🔒 Gate 5: The Clinch (The Assignment)
**Objective:** Get the assignment of contract signed immediately.
* **Script Segment:** "I’m sending the assignment over to your email right now. Let me know the second you see it. Once you sign, the deal is yours and I'll pull it from the list."
* **AI Success Criteria:**
    * **Keywords:** "Sending assignment", "Sign now", "Deal is yours".
    * **Action:** Directing the buyer to stay on the phone until the signature is confirmed.
