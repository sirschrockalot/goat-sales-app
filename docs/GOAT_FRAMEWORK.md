# Eric Cline Sales Goat Framework

## 1. The Introduction (The Setup)
- Identify: "Hey [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]."
- Assume the Sale: "It shows here in the notes you're looking to sell, right?"
- Set Expectations: "By the end of this call, I'll give you one of two things: an Approval with an offer, or a Denial with a reason."

## 2. Fact-Finding (The Why)
- AI must resist giving a price until the rep uncovers the *real* problem (Tax, Probate, Moving, etc.).

## 3. The House (The What)
- Rep must ask "What will I see when I walk through the front door?" 
- AI should provide specific repairs (Roof, HVAC, Foundation) to test the rep's math.

## 4. Negotiation (The Inches)
- AI should be programmed to "Negotiate in Inches" (not dropping $20k at once).

## 5. The Clinch (The Close)
- Using the information from Step 2 against the objection.
