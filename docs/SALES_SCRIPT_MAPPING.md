🐐 Sales Goat: Script Logic Map (2.0 Wholesale Edition - Presidential Digs)
This document defines the semantic success criteria for the AI Coach to monitor adherence to the Presidential Digs Real Estate Wholesaling Sales Script 2.0.

## PRE-GAME PRINCIPLES
- It takes time to take houses. Be patient and stay consistent.
- Treat every single lead the same. No prejudging.
- Sales are relationships, not transactions.
- Be likeable. Sellers say yes to people they trust and like.
- Stick to the script. Freestyle only after you've earned it.
- Love the one you're with. Focus 100% on this seller, this call.
- Make the offer. Every qualified lead should get an offer.

## 🏁 Gate 1: INTRO (2–3 MINUTES)
**Goal:** Build instant rapport, set the frame, and confirm they're open to an offer.

### Opener
**Script Segment:** "Hi, [SELLER NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] with Presidential Digs Real Estate. How are you doing today?"
- (Pause. Let them answer. Match their energy.)

### Reason for the call
**Script Segment:** "I'm calling about your property at [PROPERTY ADDRESS]. You popped up on our radar because you might be open to selling, and my job is to see whether your property even qualifies for one of our offers. Would it be okay if I ask you a few quick questions to see if it makes sense for us to move forward?"
- (Wait for "yes.")

### Set expectations
**Script Segment:** "Just so you know how this works, [SELLER NAME]: I'll ask a few questions about the property and your situation. I'll see what numbers make sense on our end. By the end of the call, one of three things will happen: 1. We'll approve the property and make you an offer. 2. We'll say it doesn't fit our buying criteria and explain why. 3. Or we'll decide it's not a fit right now and part as friends. Does that sound fair?"

### CONTACT / CREDIBILITY STEP
**Script Segment:** "Before we dive in, do me a favor and grab a pen and paper so you know exactly who you're dealing with."
- (Pause while they grab one. If they're driving: "If you're driving or don't have a pen, no worries — I'll text this to you after the call.")
- "Okay, write this down: My name is [YOUR NAME]. Our company is Presidential Digs Real Estate. Our best callback number is [COMPANY PHONE]. And our website is [COMPANY WEBSITE]. Can you read that number back to me so I know you've got it right?"
- (Let them repeat it.)
- "Perfect, appreciate that. Let's talk about the property."

**AI Success Criteria:**
- Keywords: "Presidential Digs Real Estate", "qualifies", "three things", "approve", "doesn't fit", "sound fair", "pen and paper", "read that number back"
- Tone: Match their energy, friendly and professional
- Logic Gate: Must confirm "Does that sound fair?" before proceeding
- Credibility: Must ask for pen/paper and have them repeat the number back

## 🕵️ Gate 2: FACT FIND – MOTIVATION (5–10 MINUTES)
**Goal:** Find out why they're selling and how strong their motivation is.

### Opening Question
**Script Segment:** "Catch me up to speed, [SELLER NAME] — what's got you even thinking about selling this house?"
- (Then shut up and let them talk. Take notes.)

### KEY MOTIVATION QUESTIONS
- Is this a rental or your primary home?
- How long have you owned the property?
- Are you local to [CITY/STATE] or out of state?
- What do you like most about the property?
- What do you not like about it?
- When you sell, what are you hoping to do with the money? (Pay off debt? Move closer to family? Downsize? Avoid repairs?)
- Drill deeper when they give a surface answer: "Tell me a little more about that."

### RAPPORT QUESTIONS
- Are you married or do you have any other decision-makers involved in this?
- Is there anyone else who would need to sign off if we move forward?
- How soon would you like to have this behind you if everything lined up?

**AI Success Criteria:**
- Intent Detection: Identify the reason (Motivation) for selling (e.g., Probate, Taxes, Landlord frustration, Moving, Debt, Repairs)
- Question Mix: Must detect transition from rapport (Married? Decision-makers?) to motivation (What's the game plan? What do you hope to do with the money?)
- Silence Metric: AI should detect a 3-5 second pause after "What's got you even thinking about selling?" to allow the seller to speak
- Drill Deeper: Rep uses "Tell me a little more about that" when seller gives surface answers
- Timeline: Must ask "How soon would you like to have this behind you?"

## 🎤 Gate 3: FACT FIND – CONDITION (THE PITCH SETUP) (5–10 MINUTES)
**Goal:** Understand the condition so your offer makes sense and feels justified.

### Opening Question
**Script Segment:** "Let's talk about the house itself for a second. If I was walking through with you right now, what would I be seeing?"

### EXTERIOR & STRUCTURE
- What's the exterior? (Brick, siding, stucco?)
- Any known foundation issues? Cracks, shifting, doors sticking?
- How's the roof? Any leaks, missing shingles, or soft spots?
- Any major work done to the exterior in the last 5–10 years?

### INTERIOR
- What kind of flooring do you have throughout? (Carpet, tile, hardwood, vinyl?)
- Have the kitchen and bathrooms been updated, or are they mostly original?
- Any plumbing or electrical issues you're aware of?
- How old is the HVAC system? Water heater?

### MAJOR SYSTEMS / BIG-TICKET ITEMS
- When was the last time the roof was replaced?
- Any issues with the electrical panel? Ever been upgraded?
- Any plumbing problems? Slow drains, leaks, backups?
- Any known mold, water damage, or past flooding?

### TIMELINE / FLEXIBILITY
**Script Segment:** "If we were able to agree on a number that made sense to both of us, how soon would you be ready to close?"
- Options: "As soon as possible" → High motivation | "Whenever" → Lower motivation; dig deeper

**AI Success Criteria:**
- Condition Keywords: "Foundation", "roof", "kitchen", "bathrooms", "HVAC", "water heater", "electrical", "plumbing", "mold", "water damage"
- The Walkthrough: Rep asks "If I was walking through with you right now, what would I be seeing?"
- Major Systems: Must ask about roof, foundation, HVAC, electrical, plumbing
- Timeline Confirmation: Must ask "How soon would you be ready to close?"

## 💰 Gate 4: TRANSITION TO NUMBERS (THE PITCH – OUTSIDE & INSIDE)
**Goal:** Position yourself as a problem solver, not a lowball buyer.

### The Rehab Question
**Script Segment:** "Okay, [SELLER NAME], I appreciate you walking me through all of that. Let me ask you this: if you had, say, $20,000 to $30,000 to put into the property, where do you think it would need to go first?"
- (Let them "spend" the rehab money. This builds your justification later.)

### QUICK NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK
- What's the neighborhood like — more owners or renters?
- Any problem neighbors or issues on the street?
- Anyone else on the block fixing up houses?
- "If I were driving the neighborhood, is there anything big I would notice that we haven't talked about yet?"

### GET THEIR NUMBER (IF POSSIBLE)
**Script Segment:** "Have you thought about what you'd need to walk away with for this place to make sense for you?"
- If they give a number: "Thanks for sharing that. How did you arrive at that figure?"
- If they refuse to give a number: "No problem, I'll do the legwork on my side and see what comes back. My job is to see if there's a number that works for both of us."

**AI Success Criteria:**
- The Rehab Question: Must ask "If you had $20,000 to $30,000 to put into the property, where do you think it would need to go first?"
- Neighborhood Check: Ask about owners vs renters, problem neighbors, other fix-ups
- Get Their Number: Ask "What you'd need to walk away with" and follow up appropriately

## ⏸️ Gate 5: RUNNING COMPS / SHORT HOLD
**Goal:** Create a natural pause while you "run numbers," even if it's scripted.

**Script Segment:** "Alright, [SELLER NAME], here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to plug everything you told me into our system and see what this looks like from an investor standpoint. It usually takes me a couple of minutes. Can you hang on the line while I do that, or would you rather I call you right back?"
- (Use this time to estimate your max offer.)

**AI Success Criteria:**
- The Hold Logic: Rep must effectively set up the hold: "I'm going to plug everything you told me into our system"
- Options: Give seller choice to "hang on the line" or "call you right back"

---

## 💵 Gate 6: THE OFFER (1–3 MINUTES)
**Goal:** Come back confident and calm. Present the offer clearly.

### Setting Up the Offer
**Script Segment:** "Okay, [SELLER NAME], thanks for hanging in there. I've got some good news and some things I want to walk you through. The way we buy is as-is: You don't have to fix anything. You don't have to clean the house. We cover normal closing costs. You pick the closing date that works best for you. In exchange, we need to buy it at a number that makes sense for us as investors."

### PRESENTING THE NUMBER
**Script Segment:** "Based on the condition of the property, the repairs we talked about, and what similar homes are going for in that area, the number that makes the most sense for us is: $[OFFER PRICE]."
- Then stop talking. Let them react.

### IF THEY PUSH BACK
**Script Segment:** "I completely understand. Let me ask you this: What number did you have in mind that would make this a no-brainer for you?"

**If their number is too high:**
**Script Segment:** "I appreciate you sharing that. The challenge for us is that once we factor in repairs, holding costs, and resale, we just can't get to that number and still stay in business. If we could at least meet in the middle at $[COUNTER OFFER], that would really be us stretching to make this work. If we can do that, are you ready to move forward?"

**AI Success Criteria:**
- AS-IS Definition: Rep explains as-is means "don't have to fix anything", "don't have to clean", "we cover closing costs", "you pick the closing date"
- Presenting the Number: Must say "Based on the condition of the property, the repairs we talked about, and what similar homes are going for in that area, the number that makes the most sense for us is: $[OFFER PRICE]"
- The Pivot: If the price is rejected, rep must ask "What number did you have in mind?" and then pivot to meeting in the middle
- Stop Talking: After presenting the number, rep must pause and let seller react

## 🔒 Gate 7: THE CLOSE – SETTING EXPECTATIONS
**Goal:** Once you're close on price, set clear expectations for next steps.

**Script Segment:** "Here's what the next steps look like so there are no surprises. 1. Agreement: We'll send over a simple purchase agreement for $[FINAL PRICE]. It's 2–3 pages, plain English. 2. Welcome Call: Our transaction coordinator will give you a welcome call, go over the timeline, and answer any questions. 3. Photos / Walkthrough: We'll schedule a quick walkthrough or photos of the property — usually within a few days. 4. Title Work: The title company will do their job in the background and make sure everything is clear so you can get paid. 5. Closing: On closing day, you'll sign the final paperwork and get your funds — either by wire or check, whichever you prefer. Does that all sound good to you?"

**AI Success Criteria:**
- Process Setup: Must mention all 5 steps: Agreement, Welcome Call, Photos/Walkthrough, Title Work, Closing
- Agreement Details: Mention "2–3 pages, plain English"
- Payment Options: Mention "wire or check, whichever you prefer"
- Confirmation: Must ask "Does that all sound good to you?"

---

## ✅ Gate 8: FINAL COMMITMENT QUESTIONS
**Goal:** Secure the commitment before sending the agreement.

**Script Segment:** "Just so we're on the same page, if we lock this in at $[FINAL PRICE], are you 100% ready to move forward and sell the property to us?"

**If yes:**
**Script Segment:** "Awesome. I'll get the agreement sent to [SELLER EMAIL]. When you get it, I can stay on the line and walk you through the main points. It'll only take a couple of minutes."

**AI Success Criteria:**
- Closing Intent: Detect the "Assume the Close" mentality with "are you 100% ready to move forward?"
- Final Verification: Must confirm email address and offer to "stay on the line and walk you through the main points"
