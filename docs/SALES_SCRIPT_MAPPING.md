🐐 Sales Goat: Script Logic Map (2.0 Wholesale Edition)
This document defines the semantic success criteria for the AI Coach to monitor adherence to the Eric Cline Wholesaling Script 2.0.

🏁 Gate 1: The Intro (The "Old Friend" Entry)
Objective: Set the "Approval/Denial" frame and build immediate energy.

Script Segment: "Hi (Name), this is (My Name)! I’m calling about your property on (Address)... I can promise you one of two things: I’m either going to give you an approval with an offer, or a denial with the reason why. Fair enough?"

AI Success Criteria:

Keywords: "Approval", "Denial", "Fair enough?", "Solid fit".

Tone: High energy (match old friend vibe), 130-150 WPM.

Logic Gate: Must confirm the "Fair enough?" agreement before proceeding.

Pen & Paper Check: Rep must ask the seller to "grab a pen and paper" and verify the office number.

🕵️ Gate 2: Fact Find (The "Motivation" Dig)
Objective: Uncover the "Why" and build a human connection without being a robot.

Script Segment: "Catch me up to speed, (Name). What's got you even thinking about selling?"

AI Success Criteria:

Intent Detection: Identify the reason (Motivation) for selling (e.g., Probate, Taxes, Landlord frustration).

Third-Party Stories: Rep uses a story or example of helping someone else in a similar situation.

Question Mix: Must detect a transition from rapport (Married? Kids?) to motivation (What's the game plan after?).

Silence Metric: AI should detect a 3-5 second pause after the "What's got you thinking about selling?" prompt to allow the seller to speak.

🎤 Gate 3: The Pitch (The "Inside/Outside" Walkthrough)
Objective: Problem-solve and create a "Mental Walkthrough" for the underwriter.

Script Segment: "We open the front door—what am I seeing?... If you had $20-$30k to spend updating, where would you put it?"

AI Success Criteria:

Condition Keywords: "Kitchen original", "Slab/Basement", "Unpermitted", "Structural issues".

The "Shoes" Question: Rep asks, "If you were in my shoes, is there anything you'd want to know that I haven't asked?"

Timeline Confirmation: Must confirm if the 45-day close works for the seller.

The Hold Logic: Rep must effectively set up the "3-minute hold" for underwriters.

💰 Gate 4: The Offer (The "Virtual Withdraw" Anchor)
Objective: Negotiate with "Pain & Circumstances" rather than just dollars.

Script Segment: "Your property was just approved for purchase... We’ve moved your funds into a Virtual Withdraw Account. Write this reference number down: (VW ##)."

AI Success Criteria:

AS-IS Definition: Rep explains as-is means "don't have to lift a finger" or "junk in the garage".

Urgency/Scarcity: Mention this is the first one green-lit in five days.

The Pivot: If the price is rejected, rep must loop back to the seller's "Pain" (Motivation) rather than just negotiating money.

🔒 Gate 5: The Close (The "Agreement" Walkthrough)
Objective: Secure the signature and set expectations for the next 72 hours.

Script Segment: "Let's verify your name and address... I'm sending a simple two-page agreement. It's written in third-grade English."

AI Success Criteria:

Closing Intent: Detect the "Assume the Close" mentality.

Process Setup: Mention the "Transaction Coordinator" call (24h) and "Photographer" (72h).

Final Verification: Verify the signature is being handled live on the call (e.g., "Do you see it? Click send.").
