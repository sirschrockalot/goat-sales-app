# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

- Use the Sales Goat logo (🐐) or a stylized version
- Match the dark theme aesthetic (#0B0E14 background)
- Include emerald green (#22C55E) accent color
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes

## Quick Creation

You can create placeholder icons using:
- Figma
- Canva
- Any image editor
- Or use a simple emoji-based icon generator

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
